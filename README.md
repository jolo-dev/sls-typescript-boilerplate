# What's that?

A boilerplate for [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com).

# Why?

Saving time setting up a serverless project using Typescript.

# What's included

- Typescript-Webpack configuration
- Prettier
- Jest
- EsLint
- Serverless Configuration for AWS
- VS-Code Settings

# How to use

```bash
npm install
```

It is not necessarily to have Serverless-CLI install when having NodeJS.

```bash
sls deploy
# or alternatively
npx sls deploy
```
